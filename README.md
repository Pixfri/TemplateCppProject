# TemplateCppProject
This is just a simple template I use to generate a classic C++ project with xmake

# Using this template
Just click on the button `Use this template` and `Create a new repository` then enter all the informations.

Make sure to replace everything called `ProjectName` in the xmake.lua file by your project name and also rename the `ProjectName` folder.
